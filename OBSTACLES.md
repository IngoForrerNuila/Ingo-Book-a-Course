*Obstacles during the process of programing the website*
by Ingo (°___°)

-USAGE OF FIGMA-
At the very begginning I was using "Figma" in the wrong way, creating really poor detailed ideas of the website without taking advantage of its tools and capabilities

-HTML and BOOTSTRAP5-
Using HTML and Bootstrap5 is for sure one of the the best ways at the moment for me to design a website, using containers gives me freedom to be more creative and handle, move all elements through the website much better.

-CREATIVITI, VISUALS AND STRUCTURE-
Since I am learning how to use GIMP and INKSCAPE instead of using photoshop and ilustrator has been more dificult for me to create better details for the website and also consumed a lot of my time. But since these aplications can be downloaded for free I feel the time invested by learning how to use these tools wort it.

Unfortunately I need to learn more about animations and videos, I discovered that CANVA can make really nice MP4 Clips too Late... My website looks so Static even older like websites back in 2010 U__U that is what I personaly feel. It is difficult for me updating myself I just remember what I was using FIREWORKS and DREAMWEAVER in which we had to chop all the visuals of a website or the structure of a website in tiny pieces of images, so the website loads faster Online.

I need to improve the way I am designing for example the "Size of Images and Text" without taking in consideration the "Mobile Pre View" I used to make everything big... probably because personally I have difficult reading "Small Images or Text" that is something I feel it is for me necessary to overcome, checking more websites and take in consideration the "Mobile Perspective" that also changes the way of designing a website, the size of the elements and gives you "Guidance" about how the graphic flow needs to be.


-JAVASCRIPT-

This is of course the most difficult part and the one that consumes a lot of time "Understanding the code" and "Understanding the Structure of the code".
Like a normal language there is a structure to follow in order to give a command, this is a really powerful language, however when it comes to "Logics" and some "Matemathic Proceses" I normally struggle. 

What is helping me a lot are Tutorials through Youtube, how they explain make this language looks easie, however sometimes these Tutorials are "Defaced" and useless :/ but with time for me to read, analize and testing, playing with the code I was able to undestand it and reach good results, of course "Julian" has been like an angel helping me with the "Code Undestaing". With time I expect learning more and being able to understand much better the correct "Logical Usage" of JavaScript regarding structure and commands.
