Book a Course

Here I have created the very first version of a special school dedicated to teach the most popular intergalatic languages from the Star Trek Universe.
In this website we wanted to make a single designe for all the different pages: index, form and confirmation screen. During the process new ideas came to 
my head as an example: creating a "read more" botton for each language, so our clieants or visitors have the posibility of checking more information
regarding the History, Culture and Curious facts about the language desired, in few words, what I wanted with that "Read More" botton is to give a 
background for every language offered. 

The structure of the website it is clear:

-INDEX-
An Index in which our potential clients can understand easily our product and apply for them "subscribing" themselves. Following the suggestions provided 
by Chris, I opted for showing 3 different cointainers with an atractive image giving immediate reference of the product itself: Klingonese, Vulcan and Romulan. With two different bottons "Subscribe" and "Read More" Being honest I had not enough time to work on each "Read More" section but of course it is something I am going to do during the weekend.

The index has a very humble navigation bar that offers our Mobile users or visitors to move through the website easier with 3 different options: Klingonese, Vulcan and Romulan. Each option scrolls the screen, helping our users navigating faster thank scrolling manually by either using the Scrollbar through the computer or by sliding their finger.

The website of course it is going to have a way to "Log in", so our users can start receiving their language courses. Of course the "Log in" option and further page must be finished, not finished yet.

-FORM-

The form follows the same scrolling dynamic, the navigation bar helps our possible clients to navigate through mobile devices directly to the "Form" with a "GO TO FORM" link that scrolls the site automatically.

Here our clients can type the required information before subscribing, all the fields are going to be automatically validated thanks to the "JavaScript Tecnology" that check every imput field when our clients click on "Subscribe" if the information required is not there, then the system immediately points that in order to alert our clients to fill the form out correctly.

Alerted not only though "Emergent Pop up mini windows" but also in the website there is a Container a Div in which especifies what is missing, so our possible clients can see what are they doing wrong. 

-CONFIRMATION SCREEN-

The confirmation screen follows the same design, a navigation bar that states a "Congratulation Message" a message that can be clicked in order to scroll the window directly to the "Instructions and Details" There people can find the details of the course selected, with information like: Name and Last Name, Language they will learn, Language they Speak, Email and User Name used to register themselves in the Online School.

The final result of this first version of the website varies a little bit of the "Figma Design" there were some improvements and of course some ideas not completed, working further in this website will be adding not only the abscent ideas reflected in "Figma" but also new sections required to improve the whole concept and idea.
